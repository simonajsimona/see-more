  Mainly I work on projects that allow me to use a wide range of methods, including computational social science. I mostly study the influence of socio-cultural factors influencing social and health outcomes. In this regard I rely mainly on multilevel models to delineate the relative effects of different levels of operation on outcome variables.
  
  Substantively, my research interests are wide-ranging. They include global health, reproductive health, violence as well as poverty and inequality.
